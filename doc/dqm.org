** rely on ROOT web-based graphics, no need in anything else
** TODO [0/2] DQM clients run independent on ARTDAQ                          
*** connect to dispatcher at any point in time 
*** TODO currently, when a dispatcher stops, its clients also stop           
*** TODO when a client fails to disconnect, the dispatcher 'remembers' about it   
** when a client connects to the dispatcher,                                 
 it sends to the dispatcher a configuration FCHICL. 
 The dispatcher forks and spawns an art job with that FCL - see

  file:../../artdaq/artdaq/DAQrate/SharedMemoryEventManager.cc::/::RunArt/

 and it is the job which provides the transfer

** the DQM client fills histograms and tells ROOT where to display them

* DQM client FCL for the 'demo' example : [[file:../config/demo/dqm_client01.fcl]]
