# This file is an example of a settings file which would work with an
# artdaq-demo installation, assuming the installation was performed
# with artdaq-demo's quick-mrb-start.sh script. It is valid as of
# artdaq-demo v2_10_02; more details on artdaq-demo installation can
# be found in
# https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/artdaq-demo/wiki. Note that
# the user will need to (A) make sure that a directory called
# $HOME/run_records has been created and (B) make sure to set the
# productsdir_for_bash_scripts variable, below, to a products
# directory containing the xmlrpc_c package (needed for DAQInterface
# to receive commands)

# For more information on these variables and what they mean, see the
# relevant section of the DAQInterface wiki,
# https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/artdaq-utilities/wiki/The_settings_file_reference
