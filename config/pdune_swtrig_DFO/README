Sample configuration: pdune_swtrig_DFO
Notes on 04-Sep-2019, KAB

Description:
This configuration is intended to demonstrate/test the operation of
a multi-layer artdaq system that uses a DFO to direct the flow of events
from BoardReaders to EventBuilders.

Some notes:
* This configuration needs an enhanced copy of the boot.txt file, and a
  sample is included with this configuration.  It also needs a special 
  known_boardreaders_list, and that is also provided here.
  To run this demo, you can use the following commands:
  - 'cd <yourArtdaqDemoDir>'
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config pdune_swtrig_DFO --bootfile `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/pdune_swtrig_DFO/boot.txt --comps swtrig felix01 felix02 felix03 ssp01 ssp02 ssp03 --brlist `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/pdune_swtrig_DFO/known_boardreaders_list_example [--runduration 40 --partition 0 --no_om]'

* NOTE that the pull-mode data requests that are used in this sample make use of 
  multicast Ethernet messages.  As such, there may
  be firewall settings that need to be tuned.  Please see the text that describes
  this in ../README.simple_test_configs.
