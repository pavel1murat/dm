Sample configuration: config_includes
09-Apr-2018, KAB

Description:
This configuration is intended to demonstrate a way to structure the FHiCL documents
that groups related parameters into dedicated files.
Its parent is the basic "demo" configuration.  As of 18-Apr-2018, its observable output
should be very similar to the basic demo, modulo the change of the RootDAQOut compression
mode from 3 to 0.

Some notes:
* This configuration has some extra component files that typically do not get used.
  (Generally, this test only uses component01 and 02.)  The presence of the extra ones
  is partly to highlight the fact that non-fully-resolved run configuration FHiCL
  documents are currently being archived (as of 19-Apr-2018), and to allow us to check
  that the archived configurations are less verbose when we start storing fully-resolved
  FHiCL documents.
* This configuration does not currently need a special boot.txt file; however one
  is provided for reference.
* To run this configuration, you can use any of the following steps, depending on what
  you are trying to demonstrate:
  - 'cd <yourArtdaqDemoInstallationDir>'
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config config_includes'
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config config_includes --bootfile `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/config_includes/boot.txt'
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config config_includes --bootfile `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/config_includes/boot.txt --comps component01 component02 component03 component04 --'
