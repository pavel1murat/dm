Sample configuration: multiple_fragments_per_read
Notes on 26-Jun-2019, KAB (created by ELF and others)

Description:
This configuration is intended to demonstrate/test the use of a system that
produces multiple fragments within one BoardReader/FragmentGenerator.

Some notes:
* This configuration benefits from an enhanced copy of the typical boot.txt file, and a
  sample is included with this configuration.  
  To run this demo, you can use the following commands:
  - 'cd <yourArtdaqDemoInstallationDir>'
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config multiple_fragments_per_read --bootfile `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/multiple_fragments_per_read/boot.txt --comps component01 component02 component03 [--runduration 40 --partition 0 --no_om]'

* NOTE that the pull-mode data requests that are used in this sample make use of 
  multicast Ethernet messages.  As such, there may be firewall settings that need to
  be tuned.  Please see the text that describes this in ../README.simple_test_configs.
