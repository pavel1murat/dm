# This file is an example of a settings file which would work with an
# artdaq-demo installation, assuming the installation was performed
# with artdaq-demo's quick-mrb-start.sh script. It is valid as of
# artdaq-demo v2_10_02; more details on artdaq-demo installation can
# be found in
# https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/artdaq-demo/wiki. Note that
# the user will need to (A) make sure that a directory called
# $HOME/run_records has been created and (B) make sure to set the
# productsdir_for_bash_scripts variable, below, to a products
# directory containing the xmlrpc_c package (needed for DAQInterface
# to receive commands)

# For more information on these variables and what they mean, see the
# relevant section of the DAQInterface wiki,
# https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/artdaq-utilities/wiki/The_settings_file_reference

# max_fragment_size_bytes       : 1024000
# max_configurations_to_list    : 
# use_messageviewer             : true
#     By default, if windowing is supported and artdaq_mfextensions is installed, 
#     a MessageViewer window will pop up during runs which will print out messages 
#     from the artdaq processes. If you wish to disable this feature, set use_messageviewer to false.
# fake_messagefacility 
#     When set to true, DAQInterface will format its messages to appear like MessageFacility messages
# boardreader_priorities 
#     Formatted as a set of regular expressions, e.g.:boardreader_priorities: component01 component.*, 
#     this tells DAQInterface how to order the transitions it sends the BoardReader processes. 
#     In this example, in the case of "init" (during the config transition) and "start" (during the start transition), 
#     DAQInterface would first send the command for component01, wait for a successful response, 
#     and then send the commands in no particular order to the remaining components. 
#     During stop or terminate, the reverse is true.
# transfer_plugin_to_use : "Autodetect"
#     The name of the transfer plugin to use to send data between processes; defaults to "Autodetect". 
#     Only set this if you're sure you know what you're doing.
# advanced_memory_usage : "false". 
#     If set to "true", max_fragment_size_bytes must not be set as both settings deal with the same thing 
#     in mutually exclusive ways: the size of fragments and events which can pass through the artdaq system. 
#     advanced_memory_usage allows for more sophisticated fine-tuning of these sizes, and warrants its own section. 
#     Info is provided in the memory management details section.
