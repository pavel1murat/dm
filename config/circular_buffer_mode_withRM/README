Sample configuration: circular_buffer_mode_withRM (with Routing Manager)
Notes on 11-Jan-2019, KAB

Description:
This configuration is intended to demonstrate/test the use of a system that
has a BoardReader that must deal with a large number of fragments per event.
It builds on mediumsystem_with_routing_manager.

Some notes:
* This configuration benefits from enhanced copy of the typical boot.txt file, and a
  sample is included with this configuration.  To run this demo, you can use the
  following commands:
  - 'cd <yourArtdaqDemoDir>'
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config circular_buffer_mode_withRM --bootfile `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/circular_buffer_mode_withRM/boot.txt --comps component01 component02 component03 component04 component05 component06 component07 component08 component09 component10 component<N> --'
  - where component<N> picks the characteristics of the BR with a large number of fragments, <N>=11..16

* NOTE that the pull-mode data requests that are used in this sample make use of 
  multicast Ethernet messages.  As such, there may
  be firewall settings that need to be tuned.  Please see the text that describes
  this in ../README.simple_test_configs.
