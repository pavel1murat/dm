Sample configuration: simple_subsystems
Notes on 28-Mar-2019, KAB (sample created by ELF)

Description:
This configuration is intended to demonstrate/test the use of a multi-layer
artdaq system, that is, a system with multiple subsystems.  The current system
layout has components 1 and 2 sending fragments to EBs 1 and 2, which send events
to DataLogger1 which writes them to disk.  All of that is in subsystem #1.

EBs 1 and 2 also send their data to EB3 in subsystem 2.

In subsystem 2, component03 sends fragments to EB3.  component03 is configured
in Window (pull) mode.  EB3 sends events to DL2 which
writes them to disk and forwards them to Dispatcher1.

Some notes:
* This configuration needs an enhanced copy of the boot.txt file, and a
  sample is included with this configuration.  It also needs a special 
  known_boardreaders_list, and that is also provided here.
  To run this demo, you can use the following commands:
  - 'cd <yourArtdaqDemoDir>'
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config simple_subsystems --bootfile `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/simple_subsystems/boot.txt --comps component01 component02 component03 -- --brlist `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/simple_subsystems/known_boardreaders_list_example'

* NOTE that the pull-mode data requests that are used in this sample make use of 
  multicast Ethernet messages.  As such, there may
  be firewall settings that need to be tuned.  Please see the text that describes
  this in ../README.simple_test_configs.

* Also, NOTE that in an upcoming release of DAQInterface and this sample config,
  we will be able to use the following command for running this configuration:
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config simple_subsystems --bootfile `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/simple_subsystems/boot.txt --comps component01 component02 component_subsystem_2 --'

* Also, in an upcoming release of DAQInterface, boot.txt can be replaced by boot.fcl (included).
