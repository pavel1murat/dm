Sample configuration: dune_sample_system
Notes on 29-Mar-2019, KAB

Description:
This configuration is intended to demonstrate/test the use of a multi-layer
artdaq system to emulate the handling of a software trigger at protoDUNE.

Some notes:
* This configuration needs an enhanced copy of the boot.txt file, and a
  sample is included with this configuration.  It also needs a special 
  known_boardreaders_list, and that is also provided here.
  To run this demo, you can use the following commands:
  - 'cd <yourArtdaqDemoDir>'
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config dune_sample_system --bootfile `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/dune_sample_system/boot.txt --comps felixHF01 felix01 felix02 felix03 ssp01 ssp02 ssp03 --brlist `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/dune_sample_system/known_boardreaders_list_example [--runduration 40 --partition 0 --no_om]'

* NOTE that the pull-mode data requests that are used in this sample make use of 
  multicast Ethernet messages.  As such, there may
  be firewall settings that need to be tuned.  Please see the text that describes
  this in ../README.simple_test_configs.
