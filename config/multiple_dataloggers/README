Sample configuration: multiple_dataloggers
18-Apr-2018, KAB

Description:
This configuration is intended to demonstrate/test the use of multiple DataLoggers.
Its parent is the "config_includes" sample (which is intended to demonstrate a
possible reorganization of the FHiCL configuration files), and its grandparent is
the basic "demo" configuration.  As of 18-Apr-2018, its observable output should
be very similar to the basic demo, modulo the splitting of the data into 4 files
on disk and the note below about only sending events from one DL to the Dispatcher.

Some notes:
* This configuration needs an enhanced copy of the typical boot.txt file, and a
  sample is included with this configuration.  To use this file, you should first
  edit it to replace <yourArtdaqInstallationDir> with the correct path. Then,
  to run this demo, you can use the following commands:
  - 'cd <yourArtdaqDemoInstallationDir>'
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config multiple_dataloggers --bootfile `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/multiple_dataloggers/boot.txt'

* When using earlier versions of art, only one DataLogger can effectively send
  events to the Dispatcher. Of course, it is possible to configure a system to do
  otherwise, and such a system will run, but only one of the N events sent to the
  Dispatcher will be de-serializable. This is because the different DataLogger
  configurations (different RootDAQOut filenames) will violate the requirement
  that upstream art configurations must be identical in order for downstream
  processes to understand them.
  It was hoped that this restriction would be removed in art v2.08+, but that
  does not appear to be the case.  Given that, the configurations for Aggregators
  2, 3, and 4 have the rootNetOutput lines (two per file) commented out.  To run
  a test in which all four DLs send events to the Dispatcher, edit Aggregator2/3/4.fcl
  to restore the rootNetOutput lines.
