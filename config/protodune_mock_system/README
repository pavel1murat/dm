Sample configuration: protodune_mock_system
Notes on 31-Jul-2018, ELF

Description:
This configuration is designed to be a protodune-like stress-test for the mu2edaq cluster.
It consists of 24 BoardReaders, one in push mode and the rest in pull mode. The push-mode
BR generates tiny (4K) fragments, and the rest are divided between 1 MB and 15 MB Fragments.
The system generates 200 MB events, which at 25 Hz should saturate the 4 10 Gb links to the
nodes hosting the 16 EventBuilders. There is currently no disk-writing in this example.

Some notes:
* This configuration benefits from enhanced copy of the typical boot.txt file, and a
  sample is included with this configuration.  To use this file, you should first
  edit it to replace <yourArtdaqDemoDir> with the correct path. Then,
  to run this demo, you can use the following commands:
  - 'cd <yourArtdaqDemoDir>'
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config protodune_mock_system --bootfile `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/protodune_mock_system/boot.txt --comps component{01..24} --'

* Note that you will also need to install the known_boardreader_list_example included with this
  example to use all 24 components

* NOTE that the pull-mode data requests that are used in this sample make use of 
  multicast Ethernet messages.  As such, there may
  be firewall settings that need to be tuned.  Please see the text that describes
  this in ../README.simple_test_configs.
