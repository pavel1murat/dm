Sample configuration: mediumsystem_with_routing_manager
Notes on 09-Jul-2018, KAB

Description:
This configuration is intended to demonstrate/test the use of a system that
receives data in push mode from one BoardReader, pulls data from nine others,
has to deal with a relatively large amount of data (90 MB/s),
*and* uses the Routing Manager.

Some notes:
* This configuration benefits from enhanced copy of the typical boot.txt file, and a
  sample is included with this configuration.  To use this file, you should first
  edit it to replace <yourArtdaqDemoDir> with the correct path. Then,
  to run this demo, you can use the following commands:
  - 'cd <yourArtdaqDemoDir>'
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config mediumsystem_with_routing_manager --bootfile `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/mediumsystem_with_routing_manager/boot.txt --comps component01 component02 component03 component04 component05 component06 component07 component08 component09 component10 [--]|[--runduration 40 --partition 0 --no_om]'

* NOTE that the pull-mode data requests that are used in this sample make use of 
  multicast Ethernet messages.  As such, there may
  be firewall settings that need to be tuned.  Please see the text that describes
  this in ../README.simple_test_configs.
