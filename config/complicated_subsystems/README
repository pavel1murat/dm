Sample configuration: complicated_subsystems
Notes on 18-Mar-2019, ELF

Description:
This configuration is intended to demonstrate/test the use of a multi-layer
artdaq system, that is, a system with multiple subsystems.  The current system
layout has components 1, 2 and 3 sending fragments to EB 1 in subsystem #1, 
component_subsystem_2 sending to EB2 in subsystem 2 along with serialized art
events from EB1, component_subsystem_3 sending to EB3 in subsystem 3, and EB2
and EB3 sending serialized art events to EB4 in subsystem 4. DL1 and DI1 are
also in subsystem 4, writing data to disk and running online monitoring.

Some notes:
* This configuration needs an enhanced copy of the boot.txt file, and a
  sample is included with this configuration.  It also needs a special 
  known_boardreaders_list, and that is also provided here.
  To run this demo, you can use the following commands:
  - 'cd <yourArtdaqDemoDir>'
  - 'sh ./run_integration_tests.sh --config complicated_subsystems'

* NOTE that the pull-mode data requests that are used in this sample make use of 
  multicast Ethernet messages.  As such, there may
  be firewall settings that need to be tuned.  Please see the text that describes
  this in ../README.simple_test_configs.
